### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 Greetings from the data realms! I go by the name Poorna Chand Addala, a seasoned Data Engineer navigating the vast seas of large-scale data management and processing systems for over 3 years. Beyond the digital frontiers, I'm on a quest to master the intricacies of Business Analytics & Information Systems from University of South Florida.

♟️ Beyond the tech horizon, I find joy in pushing my boundaries to acquire new skills. My leisure pursuits span from delving into books and engaging in strategic chess moves to the whimsical world of left-handed writing.  

📚 Immersing myself in the world of Open Source Projects brings me immense satisfaction, fueled by a genuine enthusiasm for embracing cutting-edge technologies. 

✏️ At this very moment, my coding journey unfolds with a dance between Snowflake, Python, C#, and the enchanting realms of Machine Learning. Oh, and let's not forget my newfound love for Blogging, a venture embarked upon just recently!
